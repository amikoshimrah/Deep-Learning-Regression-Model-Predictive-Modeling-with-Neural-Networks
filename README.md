# Deep-Learning-Regression-Model-Predictive-Modeling-with-Neural-Networks
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **deep learning workflow for regression tasks** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
It shows how to preprocess data, design and train neural networks, evaluate models, and visualize performance.  
The notebook can be easily adapted to any dataset where the target variable is continuous.
